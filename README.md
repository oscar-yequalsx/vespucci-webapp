# Vespucci WebApp - Research Agent

This project demonstrates a fullstack application using a React frontend and a LangGraph-powered backend agent. The agent is designed to perform comprehensive research on a user's query by dynamically generating search terms, querying the web using Google Search, reflecting on the results to identify knowledge gaps, and iteratively refining its search until it can provide a well-supported answer with citations. This application serves as an example of building research-augmented conversational AI using LangGraph and Google's Gemini models.

## Features

- üí¨ Fullstack application with a React frontend and LangGraph backend.
- üß† Powered by a LangGraph agent for advanced research and conversational AI.
- üîç Dynamic search query generation using Google Gemini models.
- üåê Integrated web research via Google Search API.
- ü§î Reflective reasoning to identify knowledge gaps and refine searches.
- üìÑ Generates answers with citations from gathered sources.
- üîÑ Hot-reloading for both frontend and backend during development.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

-   `frontend/`: Contains the React application built with Vite.
-   `backend/`: Contains the LangGraph/FastAPI application, including the research agent logic.

## Getting Started: Development and Local Testing

Follow these steps to get the application running locally for development and testing.

**1. Prerequisites:**

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm)
-   Python 3.11+
-   **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**: The backend agent requires a Google Gemini API key.
    1.  Navigate to the `backend/` directory.
    2.  Create a file named `.env` by copying the `backend/.env.example` file.
    3.  Open the `.env` file and add your Gemini API key: `GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"`
-   **`VITE_MARKETAUX_API_KEY`** (Optional): For the news widget functionality.
    1.  Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
    2.  Create a file named `.env` by copying the `frontend/.env.example` file.
    3.  Get your API key from [MarketAux](https://www.marketaux.com/)
    4.  Open the `.env` file and add your MarketAux API key: `VITE_MARKETAUX_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY"`

**2. Install Dependencies:**

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
pip install .
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

**3. Run Development Servers:**

**For full functionality (recommended):**

```bash
make dev-all
```

This will run all three servers:
- Frontend (Vite) - Port 5173
- LangGraph Backend (AI agent) - Port 2024  
- Web API (news/heatmap) - Port 8001

**Alternative commands:**

```bash
# Run frontend and LangGraph backend only
make dev

# Run servers separately
make dev-frontend    # Frontend only
make dev-backend     # LangGraph backend only
make dev-webapi      # Web API only
```

Open your browser and navigate to the frontend development server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/app`).

## How the Backend Agent Works (High-Level)

The core of the backend is a LangGraph agent defined in `backend/src/agent/graph.py`. It follows these steps:

<img src="./agent.png" title="Agent Flow" alt="Agent Flow" width="50%">

1.  **Generate Initial Queries:** Based on your input, it generates a set of initial search queries using a Gemini model.
2.  **Web Research:** For each query, it uses the Gemini model with the Google Search API to find relevant web pages.
3.  **Reflection & Knowledge Gap Analysis:** The agent analyzes the search results to determine if the information is sufficient or if there are knowledge gaps. It uses a Gemini model for this reflection process.
4.  **Iterative Refinement:** If gaps are found or the information is insufficient, it generates follow-up queries and repeats the web research and reflection steps (up to a configured maximum number of loops).
5.  **Finalize Answer:** Once the research is deemed sufficient, the agent synthesizes the gathered information into a coherent answer, including citations from the web sources, using a Gemini model.

## CLI Example

For quick one-off questions you can execute the agent from the command line. The
script `backend/examples/cli_research.py` runs the LangGraph agent and prints the
final answer:

```bash
cd backend
python examples/cli_research.py "What are the latest trends in renewable energy?"
```


## Deployment

In production, the backend server serves the optimized static frontend build. LangGraph requires a Redis instance and a Postgres database. Redis is used as a pub-sub broker to enable streaming real time output from background runs. Postgres is used to store assistants, threads, runs, persist thread state and long term memory, and to manage the state of the background task queue with 'exactly once' semantics. For more details on how to deploy the backend server, take a look at the [LangGraph Documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/deployment_options/). Below is an example of how to build a Docker image that includes the optimized frontend build and the backend server and run it via `docker-compose`.

_Note: For the docker-compose.yml example you need a LangSmith API key, you can get one from [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/settings)._

_Note: If you are not running the docker-compose.yml example or exposing the backend server to the public internet, you should update the `apiUrl` in the `frontend/src/App.tsx` file to your host. Currently the `apiUrl` is set to `http://localhost:8123` for docker-compose or `http://localhost:2024` for development._

**1. Build the Docker Image:**

   Run the following command from the **project root directory**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t vespucci-webapp -f Dockerfile .
   ```
**2. Run the Production Server:**

   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key> LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your_langsmith_api_key> docker-compose up
   ```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8123/app/` to see the application. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8123`.
